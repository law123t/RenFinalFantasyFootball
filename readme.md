# FinalFantasyFootball

## Problem Statement
*In this project, I plan to address the problem of having the freedom to project and simulate football
teams. With this application users will be able to build teams freely and efficiently, without 
having to do multiple. time consuming drafts just to project season outcomes or draft priority

## Application Details
*This application will have 3 main functions; a function that allows free draft called "Sandbox Draft", 
a function that simulates drafting with only one user called "Priority Draft", and a "Head to Head"
that allows for team vs team simulation.

### Sandbox Draft
Allows for freeform teams, this gives freedom to users to create their own dream "super teams"
and to see how they fare against others

### Priority Draft
Gives a more realistic approach, this assigns players with a certain amount of priority points
and it gives users a limited amount of points that can be used to build a team. This takes the 
time out of mock drafts and gives players insight on how they should prioritize thier teambuilding

### Head To Head
This is the application that allows users to simulate a head to head with a random team either
in the entire database, or thier own teams. Doing this will give stats on the simulated game. 
This part of the application will also allow for a "simulated season" option, that just runs
the simulation 16 times, giving only the total season points and amounts of wins and losses.
